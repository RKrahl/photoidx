The package provides a command line tool to manipulate the metadata
and a graphical image viewer.

   completely tested.

Required library packages:

 + `PyYAML`_

 + `gexiv2`_

 + `PySide`_

Optional library packages, only needed to run the test suite:

 + `pytest`_

 + `distutils-pytest`_


Installation
------------

This package uses the distutils Python standard library package and
follows its conventions of packaging source distributions.  See the
documentation on `Installing Python Modules`_ for details or to
customize the install process.

  1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source
     directory.

  2. Build::

       $ python setup.py build

  3. Test (optional)::
