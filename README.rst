photoidx - Maintain indices for photo collections
=================================================

This package maintains indices for photo collections.  The index is
stored as a YAML file and contains metadata and tags describing the
photos.  The photos are accessed read only.

The package provides a command line tool to create and manipulate the
index and a graphical image viewer.


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 3.6 or newer.

Required library packages:

+ `setuptools`_

+ `PyYAML`_

+ `exif`_ >= 0.8.3

+ `PySide`_

Optional library packages:

+ `vignette`_ >= 4.3.0

  Needed to cache thumbnail images for the overview window.  If
  vignette is not available, everything will still work, but
  displaying the overview window may be significantly slower.

+ vignette needs at least one thumbnail backend, either `Pillow`_ or
  `PyQt5`_.  If no suitable backend is found, vignette will be
  disabled in photoidx.

+ `setuptools_scm`_

  The version number is managed using this package.  All source
  distributions add a static text file with the version number and
  fall back using that if `setuptools_scm` is not available.  So this
  package is only needed to build out of the plain development source
  tree as cloned from GitHub.

+ `pytest`_ >= 3.0.0

  Only needed to run the test suite.

+ `pytest-dependency`_

  Only needed to run the test suite.  (Actually, you can run the test
  suite even without it, but dependencies between tests will be
  ignored then.)

+ `distutils-pytest`_

  Only needed to run the test suite.
