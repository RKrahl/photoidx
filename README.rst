photo-tools - Tools for photo collections
=========================================

This package provides tools for the management of photo collections.
It maintains an index of the photos in a text file.  All metadata is
stored in this index file in YAML format, the photos are accessed read
only.

The package provides a command line tool to manipulate the metadata
and a graphical image viewer.


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 3.6 or newer.

Required library packages:

+ `setuptools`_

+ `PyYAML`_

+ `exif`_ >= 0.8.3

+ `PySide`_

Optional library packages:

+ `vignette`_ >= 4.3.0

  Needed to cache thumbnail images for the overview window.  If
  vignette is not available, everything will still work, but
  displaying the overview window may be significantly slower.

+ `setuptools_scm`_

  The version number is managed using this package.  All source
  distributions add a static text file with the version number and
  fall back using that if `setuptools_scm` is not available.  So this
  package is only needed to build out of the plain development source
  tree as cloned from GitHub.

+ `pytest`_ >= 3.0.0

  Only needed to run the test suite.

+ `pytest-dependency`_

  Only needed to run the test suite.  (Actually, you can run the test
  suite even without it, but dependencies between tests will be
  ignored then.)

+ `distutils-pytest`_

  Only needed to run the test suite.
